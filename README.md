# AndroidX.Core.SplashScreen
Xamarin C# Bindings for the Android SplashScreen Compat library (core-splashscreen-1.0.0-alpha02.aar).

### Note: This is only meant to be used temporarily until the official Nuget package from the Xamarin Team is released.
For this reason, I don't plan on publishing this to Nuget.
See https://github.com/xamarin/AndroidX/issues/455 for more information.

## Setup instructions
- Clone & build the project in Visual Studio
- Add the output DLL as a reference to your Android project
- Add the [Xamarin.Kotlin.StdLib](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Kotlin.StdLib/1.5.30) package to your Android project
- Visit the [Android docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen) for further steps on how to setup a splashscreen for your app.
